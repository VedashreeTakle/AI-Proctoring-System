The COVID-19 pandemic's quick transition to online learning revealed serious flaws in remote testing platforms, including a rise in instances of plagiarism, impersonation, and improper usage of artificial intelligence-generated content. Conventional proctoring techniques are insufficient for guaranteeing academic integrity in digital tests since they are not consistent or scalable. This paper suggests an AI-based proctoring system that combines computer vision and audio analysis to monitor test-takers in real time and identify abnormalities including numerous persons, gaze shifts, lip movements, and background speech in order to overcome these difficulties. The system generates structured outputs in JSON format for transparency and post-examination assessment, and it records and documents suspicious behavior with time-stamped visual and audio evidence. The results show that the approach can provide automated, scalable, and privacy-conscious proctoring while preserving the legitimacy of online tests.
